# Tricky Tipster
Tipster bot for Discord. Gives you tips. Some even consider them valuable life lessons.

All it needs is your guild id, a voice channel id, and a text channel id. I think. In any case, it's a very simple bot and should be easy to understand.


Also, I should have named this repo something else. The other bot I'm working on is anything but simple (for me at least) and will have its own repo.
